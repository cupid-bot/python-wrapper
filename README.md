# Cupid Python Wrapper (0.2.0)

This is a wrapper written in Python for the Cupid API.

## Development

To work on this wrapper, you will need [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) (as well as [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
Pipenv can be installed through PyPI, for example `python3 -m pip install pipenv`.

Once you have pipenv installed:

1. **Create a virtual environment:** `python3 -m pipenv shell`
3. **Install development dependencies:** `pipenv install -d`
3. **Lint the project:** `pipenv run lint`
